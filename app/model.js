<h3>History</h3>

<div class="history">
    <p>Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball (11 to 16 inches or 28 to 40 cm circumference) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet, a pitcher's mound that ranges from 35 to 43 (professional is 43) feet away from home plate, and a home run fence that is 220–300 feet away from home plate, depending on the type of softball being played.[1][2] It was invented in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, United States as an indoor game.[3] The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball due to the field being smaller and the bases and the fielders being closer to home plate. There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball; yet, the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base.</p>

    <p>A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. Other national and regional governing bodies also exist, including the USSSA. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fast pitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 program; they were to be reinstated in 2020 but the 2020 Olympics were delayed due to the COVID-19 international pandemic.</p>

    <p>There are two rules codes for softball generally. In the most common type, slow-pitch softball, the ball, which can measure either 11 inches, for a women's league, or 12 inches, for a men's league, in circumference, must arch on its path to the batter, and there are 10 players on the field at once.[4] Bunting and stealing bases are not permitted. In fast pitch softball, the pitch is fast, there are nine players on the field at one time, and while bunting and stealing bases are permitted, leading off is not.[5] Fast pitch is the most common form of softball in some states, such as Virginia. Softball rules vary somewhat from those of baseball. Two major differences are that the ball must be pitched underhand—from 50 ft (15.2 m) in slow pitch, or 46/43 ft (14/13.1 m)[6] for men/women in fast pitch as compared with 60.5 ft (18.4 m) in baseball—and that seven innings, or 1–2 hours depending on the league, constitute a regulation game compared with nine innings in baseball.[7]</p>

    <p>The name "softball" was given to the game in 1926.[8] Despite the name, the ball used in modern softball is not soft, unless using a foam practice ball. It is about 12 in (about 30 cm) in circumference (11 or 12 in for slow-pitch), which is 3 in (8 cm) larger than a baseball. Softball recreational leagues for children use 11-inch balls until around age 13. The infield in softball is smaller than on an adult or high school baseball diamond but identical to that used by Little League Baseball; each base is 60 ft (18 m) from the next, as opposed to baseball's 90 ft (27 m). In fast pitch softball the entire infield is dirt, whereas the infield in baseball is grass except at the bases and on the pitcher's mound which are dirt. Softball mounds are also flat, while baseball mounds are a small hill. Softballs are pitched underhand, but baseballs are pitched overhand. This changes the arc of the ball when approaching the plate. For example, if the pitcher pitches a fastball, in softball the ball would most likely rise while in baseball because the pitcher is on a hill, the ball would drop.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>Fast pitch softball is played between two teams on a large field, with 9 players (in 10u and above. 8u and below is usually played with 10 players on a field at once.) from one team on the field at a time. Slow-pitch softball is played with ten fielders but can be played with nine if needed. The field is usually composed of a dirt or brick-dust (colloquially called "sand") infield that contains the shape and running areas of a diamond and a grass outfield. However, the field can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial turf or asphalt. There are four bases on the infield: First base, second base, third base, and home plate. The bases are arranged in a square and are typically 60 feet (18 m) apart. Near the center of this square is the pitcher's mound, and within the circle is the "rubber", a small flat rectangular piece of rubber about a foot and a half in length. The rubber can be 40 or 43 feet away in fast pitch, or 43, 46 or 50 feet in slow pitch, from home plate, depending on age level and the league one is playing in.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to score more runs (points) than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching each one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic material. It is 11 to 12 inches (28–30 cm) (or, rarely, 16 in or 41 cm[26]) in circumference. The game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires. Players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play (called a time out), or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear.</p>

<p>The game is played in usually seven innings. Each inning is divided into a top half, in which the away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team occupies the field and tries to record three outs; then a bottom half, when the teams' roles are reversed. Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings.</p>

<h1>Defense</h1>
<h3>Positions</h3>
<p>
  There are nine players out on the field at one time in fastpitch
  softball and 10 players in slow-pitch softball. Although the pitcher and
  catcher have the ball the most, each person has a specific job. In the
  infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman,
  shortstop, and third baseman. In the outfield there is a left fielder,
  center fielder, and right fielder. In slow-pitch softball there is an
  extra outfielder in the outfield, who is specified as a roamer or rover.
  Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning
  there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and
  right fielder. The recent trend with tournament and league slow pitch
  softball play is to field 5 infielders instead of 4 outfielders. The
  extra infielder is commonly placed behind the pitcher on either side of
  2nd base

      <h3>Pitcher</h3>
      <p>
        The pitcher is the individual who throws the ball from the middle
        of the diamond. As in baseball, fastpitch softball has a rubber
        used to control the pitchers delivery. A pitcher must have both
        feet on the rubber at the start of their delivery but neither foot
        is on the rubber when the ball is released. In baseball, the
        rubber is on a mound of dirt as gravity is used to generate speed.
        In softball, the pitchers throw from within a circle and the
        rubber in the circle is not elevated. The circle is also used to
        control base runners. When the pitcher is in possession of the
        ball in the circle, a runner who has passed a base must either
        advance or return to the base. They cannot "bait" the pitcher to
        throw or they will be called out. The pitcher tries to throw the
        ball in the strike zone. In order to do that, they start while
        having the ball in their glove, they throw their arms behind their
        hips, they shoot forwards with their leg, which is on the same
        side as their glove, and leave their glove hand there and the
        other arm goes around the shoulder, bends the elbow, and turns
        their wrist toward the 3rd baseman, and brings their arm through
        at the end, flicks their wrist, (which affects the ball's speed,
        spin and subsequent motion), and brings the arm up, with the hand
        by their shoulder. They follow through with their legs turning
        their pitching stance into a fielding stance. They try to release
        the ball when they go past their hips. In softball, the pitcher
        uses an underarm motion to pitch the ball towards the strike zone.
        As soon as the pitcher makes a throw, the fielders are ready to
        field balls that are hit in the middle of the diamond.[47]
        Pitchers usually tend to be tall, very flexible and have good
        upper body strength. Pitchers can be righthanded or lefthanded.
        The softball pitcher makes a windmill motion while throwing
        underhand, unlike baseball pitchers who throw overhand.

  <div class="p2">
    <div class="left">
      <h3>Catcher</h3>
      <p>
        The catcher is normally behind home plate in a squatted position
        (some plays may require the catcher to stand at an angle for
        intentional walks). At the plate the catcher is responsible for
        catching pitches, keeping mispitched balls in front of the plate,
        calling pitches that are normally done through hand signals,
        picking off runners, and they are considered the leaders of the
        field. Catchers must know how many outs there are, the number of
        strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their
        teammates. They must also know how many runners are on base and
        where the ball should be thrown next in the following play.
        Catchers are strong, need to be smart and quick on their feet, and
        have accurate throws so they can pick runners off at each base.
        Catchers should be able to have strong and muscular legs to squat
        for a long period of time. The gear worn by a catcher protects
        them from balls thrown in the dirt or wild pitches. The catcher is
        allowed to take off his/her mask to catch a pop fly or to watch
        the play.

      <h3>First Basemen</h3>
      <p>
        The first baseman is the position to the left side of the diamond
        when facing home plate. The major role of the first baseman is to
        receive throws from other defensive players in order to get a
        force play at first base. Another role they play is to make
        fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base. The first
        baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs on the
        field. Individuals at first base have quick hands and good reach,
        and are always on the lookout to catch the player off base. They
        are also generally taller and left-handed throwing, which gives
        them an extended reach. First basemen however, can be both left-
        and right-handed. Just like the catcher, first basemen may wear
        specific first base mitts, usually having a longer web allowing
        them to reach the taller throws over their head.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="p4">
    <div class="left">
      <h3>Second/Shortstop</h3>
      <p>
        The second baseman plays in between the first baseman and second
        base itself, usually closer to second base. If the ball is hit to
        the left side of the field, the second baseman covers second base.
        If the ball is hit to right-field or center field, they become the
        cut-off for the center fielder or the right fielder depending who
        the ball was hit to. If the ball is hit to the first baseman, the
        second baseman then is responsible for covering first. If the ball
        is hit to the second baseman, they either throw the ball to second
        if there was already a player on first, or they throw to first if
        there was nobody on. If there is a runner on first and the person
        up to bat hits the ball to the shortstop or the third baseman, the
        second baseman is in charge of covering second to receive the
        throw from the shortstop or third baseman. Then, depending where
        the runner is between home and first, the second baseman makes the
        decision to throw the ball to first or to hold the ball. Also, in
        the case of a bunt, the second baseman must cover first as the
        first baseman runs to get the ball from the bunt, then it is often
        thrown back to first base.

    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <h3>Third Base</h3>
      <p>The third baseman is the position on the right side of the diamond when you are facing home plate. They are responsible for fielding all balls hit their way including bunts. In fact, the third baseman fields more bunts than a pitcher and first baseman do. Third base is also called the "Hot Corner" because the ball can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast. Third baseman must have great reflexes and be very quick on their feet because not only to they need to be quick to field a bunt but also if they are unable to predict whether the batter will bunt or hit, a ball that is hit may be a line drive to the face. It also helps if they can run fast but it isn't a requirement. A third baseman must have a very strong arm so that they can throw a runner out from across the diamond. Any ball that the third baseman can get, they should. They will have more momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop. They are also closer to first base when they cut off a slower ground ball towards shortstop. Third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times unless the ball is hit to them. In that instance, the shortstop is responsible for third base. Third baseman must be smart, have great reflexes, have a strong arm, and be quick with their hands.

    <h3>Outfield</h3>
    <p> The outfielders are players that cover the grassy area behind the
    infield. Outfielders are named for their positions in the field
    relative to home plate. Traditional outfield positions include a
    left fielder, a center fielder, and a right fielder. Each player
    has a specific job as being an outfielder.

<h1>Offense</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The offensive team sends one "batter" at a time to home plate to use the
  bat to try to hit the pitch forward into fair territory. The order the
  players bat in, known as the "batting order", must stay the same
  throughout the game. Substitutes and replacements must bat in the same
  position as the player they are replacing. In co-ed, male and female
  batters must alternate.
</p>

<p>
  The batter stands facing the pitcher inside a "batter's box" (there is
  one on each side of the plate to compensate for either right- or
  left-handed batters). The bat is held with both hands, over the
  shoulder, and away from the pitcher (90-degree angle). The ball is
  usually hit with a full swinging motion in which the bat may move
  through more than 360 degrees. The batter usually steps forward with the
  front foot, the body weight shifts forward, as the batter simultaneously
  swings the bat. A bunt is another form of batting. There are different
  types, including a sacrifice bunt, or slap bunt. There is also regular
  slapping in which a batter takes position on the left side of the plate
  and usually stands in the back of the box, but it is possible form
  anywhere. The batter takes a step back with their leading foot as the
  pitcher is in the middle of the windup, crosses over with their back
  foot and runs toward first base while they swing. There are many
  different types of slapping and they all vary depending on the batter
  and their strengths. There are half swing slaps, fake slaps, and full
  swing slaps. Each type of slap has a different purpose or goal. No
  matter what way the batter hits the ball, they must be inside the
  batter's box when the bat makes contact with the ball. If the batter
  steps out of the box while swinging, the batter is out.
</p>

<img src="images/hit1.jpg" alt="hit" />

<p>
  Once the ball is hit into fair territory, the runner must try to advance
  to first base or beyond. While running to first base, the batter is a
  "batter-runner". When she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a
  "base-runner" or "runner".
</p>

<img src="images/runner.jfif" alt="runner" />
<p>
  A batted ball hit high in the air is a "fly ball". A fly ball hit upward
  at an angle greater than 45 degrees is a "pop fly". A batted ball driven
  in the air through the infield at a height at which an infielder could
  play it if in the right position is a "line drive". A batted ball which
  hits the ground within the diamond is a "ground ball". If a batted ball
  hits a player or a base, it is considered to have hit the ground.
</p>

<p>
  A batter can also advance to first if hit by the pitch. If a batter is
  hit by the pitch it is a dead ball and she is rewarded first base. She
  must make an attempt to get out of the way and it is the umpire's
  judgmental call whether the batter attempted to move. If he feels the
  batter could have moved and avoided getting hit he or she will not
  reward the batter first base and the pitch will be recorded as a ball.

<h1>Equipment</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Equipment required in softball includes a ball, a bat (composite, metal
  or wooden), gloves, uniforms and protective gear. For example, helmets
  for the offensive team and a helmet, shin guards, and chest protector
  for the defensive catcher. Also cleats, sliding shorts, face masks and
  knee sliders may be worn for softball.

      <h3>Ball</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the sport's name, the ball is not soft at all. The size of
        the ball varies according to the classification of play; the
        permitted circumferences in international play are 12±0.125 in
        (30.5±0.3 cm), in mass between 6.25 and 7.0 oz (177–198 g) in fast
        pitch and adults and males 13 and older for slow pitch, 11±0.125
        in (27.9±0.3 cm), mass between 5.875 and 6.125 oz (166.6–173.6 g)
        in slow pitch for females 18 and younger, and kids 12 and younger.
        For comparison, under the current rules of Major League Baseball,
        a baseball has a mass between 5 and 5+1⁄4 ounces (142–149 g), and
        is 9 to 9+1⁄4 inches (229–235 mm) in circumference (2+7⁄8–3 in or
        73–76 mm in diameter).[29] A 12-inch circumference ball is
        generally used in slow pitch, although in rare cases some leagues
        (especially recreational leagues) do use a 14-inch circumference
        ball. Some balls have a raised seam, and others do not. The ball
        is most often covered in white or yellow leather in two pieces
        roughly the shape of a figure-8 and sewn together with red thread,
        although other coverings are permitted. The core of the ball may
        be made of long fiber kapok, or a mixture of cork and rubber, or a
        polyurethane mixture, or another approved material.[27] In 2004,
        high-visibility yellow "optic" covering, long-used for restricted
        flight balls in co-ed recreational leagues, became standard for
        competitive play. Yellow is the color of official NCAA and NAIA
        softballs. Yellow softballs are fast becoming the standard for all
        levels of play for girls' and women's play in particular. White
        balls are also allowed, but are very uncommon in slow pitch and
        fast pitch.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="glove">
    <div class="left">
      <h3>Glove</h3>
      <p>
        All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or
        similar material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and
        forefinger, known as the "pocket".[35] No part of the glove is
        allowed to be the same color as that of the ball, including that
        of its seams. Pitchers are also not allowed to have any white on
        their gloves including the seams. It is up to the umpire's
        discretion if he or she believes that any coloring on the glove
        interferes with or hinders the batter from seeing the ball
        clearly. Gloves used in softball are larger than the ones used in
        baseball. No glove larger than 14 in (36 cm) can be used in ASA
        (American Softball Association) sanctioned play.

    <div class="right">
      <h3>Bat</h3>
      <p>
        The bat used by the batter can be made of wood, aluminum, or
        composite materials such as carbon fiber. Sizes may vary but they
        may be no more than 34 inches (86 cm) long, 2.4 inches (6 cm) in
        diameter, or 38 ounces (1.1 kg) in mass.[32] The standard bat
        barrel diameter for both slow pitch and fast pitch softball is
        21⁄4 inches.[33] Many players prefer a smaller barrel, which
        reduces mass and allows higher swing speed. Although there are a
        variety of bats used, there are several that are banned due to
        performance enhancement. These bats are determined to be illegal
        by the Amateur Softball Association of America. For example, with
        a thinner wall, the ball recoils faster off the bat, allowing it
        to travel further. Major League Softball, played at Recreational
        Parks, include a variety of teams; Men's, Women's, Co-Ed. Each
        League has its own specific regulations with bats, but most must
        be approved by the Amateur Softball Association. Many bats may be
        "doctored" or "juiced" in a sense that they are end loaded, shaved
        and or painted. End loading of a cap refers to the addition of
        weight manually placed at the end of the barrel to distribute more
        weight at the tip. Shaving bats require machine use in order to
        remove the inner walls of the bat to improve elasticity.[34]
        Lastly, painting bats is done because competitors purchase
        "illegal" bats that are dangerous and hazardous to the opposing
        team. These three "doctored" and "juiced" techniques are banned
        from Leagues, but are still done today.

      <h3>Protective Gear</h3>
      <p>
        A helmet must have two ear flaps, one on each side. Helmets and
        cages that are damaged or altered are forbidden. Helmets must be
        worn by batters and runners. In NCAA fastpitch softball, players
        have the option to wear a helmet with or without a face mask. Most
        female travel ball teams for fastpitch softball require the batter
        to wear a helmet with a face mask. In male fastpitch masks are
        generally only used for medical reasons. In fastpitch, the catcher
        must wear a protective helmet with a face-mask and throat
        protector, shin guards and body protector. Shin guards also
        protect the kneecap.[27]
